🌐 Project Title: AURA — Autonomous RWA Liquidity Protocol
Story: Turning the Physical World into Autonomous On-Chain Liquidity
In today’s world, trillions of dollars worth of assets like gold, real estate, and invoices remain illiquid. Selling these assets takes days, weeks, or even months. This creates a massive inefficiency in global capital markets.
AURA solves this by transforming real-world assets into intelligent, liquid, on-chain financial primitives.
AURA is an autonomous protocol where real-world assets are tokenized, verified, valued by AI, and deposited into decentralized liquidity pools. Investors worldwide can instantly provide liquidity, earn yield, and participate in real-world asset markets transparently.
Unlike traditional systems, AURA introduces an AI-powered oracle that continuously evaluates asset value and updates the blockchain, ensuring liquidity pools always reflect real market conditions.
This creates a self-sustaining, intelligent, decentralized capital infrastructure.

🧱 System Overview
AURA consists of four isolated layers:
Smart Contract Layer
Chainlink Oracle Layer
Backend Oracle + AI Layer
Frontend Application Layer
Each layer has a specific responsibility and interacts with others in a secure, modular way.
________________________________________
🔗 Layer 1: Smart Contract Layer (On-Chain Core)
This layer is the trust foundation of the protocol. It runs entirely on blockchain and controls ownership, liquidity, compliance, and valuation data.
Identity Registry Contract
Purpose:
Manages verified participants in the ecosystem.
Responsibilities:
• Stores verified investor and issuer addresses
• Controls who can transfer compliant tokens
• Acts as the compliance gatekeeper
This enables ERC-3643 compliant transfers.
________________________________________
ERC-3643 RWA Token Contract
Purpose:
Represents tokenized ownership of real-world assets.
Responsibilities:
• Mint tokens representing asset value
• Restrict transfers to verified identities
• Track total supply linked to real asset value
Each token represents fractional ownership of a real asset.
Example:
Gold worth $1000 → 1000 tokens minted
Each token = $1 ownership
________________________________________
NAV Oracle Contract
Purpose:
Stores Net Asset Value determined by AI oracle.
Responsibilities:
• Store current asset valuation
• Update asset price securely
• Provide valuation data to liquidity pools
Liquidity pools rely on this to calculate yield and share value.
________________________________________
Proof of Reserve Contract
Purpose:
Ensures on-chain tokens are backed by real asset value.
Responsibilities:
• Store reserve value
• Verify supply does not exceed reserves
• Pause system if mismatch detected
This ensures financial integrity.
________________________________________
Liquidity Pool Contract
Purpose:
Acts as decentralized asset vault.
Responsibilities:
• Accept investor deposits
• Issue pool shares
• Track investor ownership
• Calculate yield based on NAV
• Enable withdrawals
This transforms static assets into liquid, yield-generating instruments.
________________________________________
🔮 Layer 2: Chainlink Oracle Layer
Chainlink provides secure infrastructure to connect off-chain intelligence with blockchain.
Chainlink Automation
Purpose:
Automates NAV updates without manual intervention.
Responsibilities:
• Trigger backend oracle updates
• Ensure daily valuation refresh
• Maintain autonomous system operation
________________________________________
Chainlink CCIP (Cross-Chain Interoperability)
Purpose:
Allows protocol to operate across multiple blockchains.
Responsibilities:
• Sync asset value across chains
• Enable cross-chain liquidity
• Expand global accessibility
________________________________________
🤖 Layer 3: Backend Oracle + AI Layer
This layer acts as the intelligent brain of the protocol.
It connects AI valuation with blockchain infrastructure.
________________________________________
AI Valuation Engine (Gemini API)
Purpose:
Determine real-time asset value.
Input:
Asset type
Asset metadata
Location
Market indicators
Previous value
Output:
Current price
Confidence score
Reserve estimate
The AI analyzes market conditions and generates valuation.
________________________________________
Oracle Service
Purpose:
Push AI valuation to blockchain.
Responsibilities:
• Call NAV Oracle contract
• Call Proof of Reserve contract
• Update blockchain state
This makes AI valuation verifiable and immutable.
________________________________________
Automation Service
Purpose:
Runs continuous valuation updates.
Runs every:
24 hours
Ensures system remains current and autonomous.
________________________________________
🖥 Layer 4: Frontend Application Layer
Built using Next.js, this layer provides user interaction.
Three dashboards exist:
________________________________________
Admin Dashboard
Purpose:
Protocol management.
Features:
• Approve issuer requests
• Approve investor verification
• Monitor pools
• View AI valuation reports
• System health monitoring
Admin acts as protocol governor.
________________________________________
Issuer Dashboard
Purpose:
Asset onboarding and management.
Features:
• Submit asset details
• Tokenize asset
• Deposit asset into liquidity pool
• Monitor asset valuation
Issuers bring real-world assets into protocol.
________________________________________
Investor Dashboard
Purpose:
Investment interface.
Features:
• Complete identity verification
• Browse liquidity pools
• Deposit funds
• Earn yield
• Withdraw liquidity
Investors provide liquidity and earn returns.
________________________________________
🔄 Complete System Lifecycle
Step 1: Asset Tokenization
Issuer submits asset → Admin approves → Token minted
Step 2: AI Valuation
AI analyzes asset → determines NAV → updates blockchain
Step 3: Liquidity Creation
Issuer deposits tokens into pool
Step 4: Investor Participation
Investor deposits capital → receives pool shares
Step 5: Continuous Valuation
AI updates NAV daily → pool value adjusts
Step 6: Yield Generation
Investor earns yield from asset appreciation
________________________________________
🧠 Autonomous Intelligence Model
The system operates as a closed feedback loop:
Asset → AI → Blockchain → Liquidity Pool → Investors → Updated Value → AI
No manual valuation required.
Fully autonomous.
________________________________________
🔐 Security Model
Trust assumptions:
Smart contracts: Trustless
Blockchain: Immutable
AI Oracle: Transparent
Identity registry: Controlled access
No centralized custody required.
